(2.40) A Karma-yogi has a resolute determination for God-\\nrealization, O Arjuna, but the desires of one who works to enjoy the \\nfruits of work are endless. (2.41)  \\nMaterial and spiritual aspects of life \\nThe misguided ones who delight in the melodious chanting of \\nthe Vedas or any scripture — without understanding its real pur-\\npose — think, O Arjuna, as if there is nothing else in it except the \\nrituals for the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment. (2.42) \\nThey are dominated by material desires and consider the attain-\\nment of heaven as the highest goal of life. They engage in specific \\nrites for the sake of prosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result \\nof their action. (2.43) The resolute determination of Self-realization \\nis not formed in the minds of those who are attached to pleasure \\nand power and whose judgment is obscured by such ritualistic ac-\\ntivities. (2.44) A portion of the Vedas deals with three modes or \\nstates of the material Nature. Become free from pairs of opposites; \\nbe ever balanced and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition \\nand preservation. Rise  above the three states, and be Self -con-\\nscious, O Arjuna. (2.45) To a Self -realized person, scriptures are \\nas useful as a small reservoir of water when the water of a huge \\nlake becomes available. (2.46)  \\nTheory and practice of Karma-yoga \\nYou have control over your respective duty only, but no control \\nor claim over the results. The fruits of work should not be your only \\nmotive and you should never be inactive. (2.47) Do your duty to \\nthe best of your ability, O Arjuna, with your mind attached to the \\nLord, abandoning worry and attachment to the results, and remain-\\ning calm in both success and failure. The calmness of mind  is \\ncalled Karma-yoga. (2.48) Work done with selfish motives is infe-\\nrior by far to selfless service or Karma-yoga. Therefore, be a \\nKarma-yogi, O Arjuna. Those who work only to enjoy the fruits of \\ntheir labor are, in truth, unhappy. Because, one has no control over \\nthe results. (2.49)  \\nA true Karma-yogi becomes free from both vice and virtue in \\nthis very life. Therefore, strive for Karma-yoga. Working to the best \\nof one’s abilities without becoming attached to the fruits of work is \\ncalled Karma-yoga. (2.50) Wise Karma-yogis are freed from the \\nbondage of rebirth by renouncing attachment to the fruits of all \\nwork and attain a blissful divine sta te. (2.51) When your intellect \\ncompletely pierces the veil of confusion, then you will become in-\\ndifferent to what has been heard and what is to be heard from the \\nscriptures.
